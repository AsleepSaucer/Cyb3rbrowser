# Cyberbrowser
# The goal with this project was to create a fully funtional web browser
# The program uses modules from the PyQt5 library and QtWebEngine module
# additional features may be added in the future
# as of current, there is an error in the PyQtwebengine library making the browser unnable to access the web.
# I have tried to find a fix for this issue, and even tried looking at different code and different libraries for a solution.
# After researching the issue it looks like pyqt5 is having some problems as the project moves forward to use pyqt6, and pyqt6 isn't far enough along in its development to help with this project
# currently planning to rework this project after pyqt6 has had more time under development.
