# Cyberbrowser
# The goal with this project was to create a fully funtional web browser
# The program uses modules from the PyQt5 library and QtWebEngine module
# additional features may be added in the future
# as of current, there is an error in the PyQtwebengine library making the browser unnable to access the web.
# I have tried to find a fix for this issue, and even tried looking at different code and different libraries for a solution.
